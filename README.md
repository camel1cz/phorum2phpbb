============

phpBB plugin (convertor) to migrate from Phorum5 to phpBB 3.

### History

This is quite old code, I used back in 2009 to migrate one quite huge Phorun5 board to phpBB3.

Since then, there are still people finding it useful.

You can find the discussion about it <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=1690005">in phpbb.com community board</a>.

Feel free to leave feedback and/or contribute.

### Usage

- download this code as ZIP (link is the right)
- extract it in the phpbb root directory before you install phpbb
- during installation of phpbb, there will be available conversion from Phorum
